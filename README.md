GoKML
=====

A simple KML library written out of necessity by [brainofdane]
(http://brainofdane.com) in Go.

Overview
--------

GoKML was written to make it easier to write KML documents. Though KML documents
are only XML documents at heart, GoKML tries to embrace the idea of containers
and groups of placemarks without having to think too hard about the structure of
the underlying XML.

This is still very much a work in progress, and I intend to clean it up and add
some test coverage (argh! Tests first! I know!). Stuff will probably break, so
use at your own risk.

Documentation
-------------

For better documentation on how to use GoKML, please visit the ever-useful
[godoc documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/dahenson/gokml).
I try to be fairly helpful in my comments, but if you find issues please contact
