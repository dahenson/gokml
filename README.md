GoKML
-----

A simple KML library written out of necessity by [brainofdane]
(http://brainofdane.com) in Go.

Overview
========

GoKML was written to make it easier to write KML documents. Though KML documents
are only XML documents at heart, GoKML tries to embrace the idea of containers
and groups of placemarks without having to think to hard about the structure of
the underlying XML.

Documentation
=============

For better documentation on how to use GoKML, please visit the ever-useful
[godoc documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/dahenson/gokml).
I try to be fairly helpful in my comments, but if you find issues please contact
